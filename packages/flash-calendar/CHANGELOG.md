## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 9bf22ed: Flash Calendar 1.0.0 ðŸš¢ ðŸŽ‰

  This release officially marks the package as production-ready (`1.0.0`).
  While it's been stable since the first release, bumping to `1.0.0` was something
  I had in mind for a while.

  - New: Add `.scrollToMonth` and `.scrollToDate`, increasing the options available for imperative scrolling.

  ## Breaking changes

  This release introduces one small change in behavior if your app uses
  imperative scrolling. Previously, `.scrollToDate` would scroll to the month
  containing the date instead of the exact date. Now, `.scrollToDate` scrolls
  to the exact date as implied by the name.

  If you intentionally want to scroll to the month instead, a new `.scrollToMonth`
  method is available (same signature).

  I don't expect this to cause any issues, but worth mentioned
  nonetheless.
